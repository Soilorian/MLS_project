# Machine Language Structure Project

This repository contains two programs developed as part of the "Machine Language Structure" course. The programs are implemented in both Intel and IBM assembly languages and serve two purposes:

1. **Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF) Calculator:**  
   This program calculates the Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF) of a given matrix. The RREF is a fundamental concept in linear algebra used for solving systems of linear equations and various other applications.

2. **Big Number Calculator (256-bit):**  
   The second program deals with computing big numbers with a precision of 256 bits. It provides arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for handling large numbers efficiently.

## Programs Overview

### RREF Calculator
- **Purpose:** Computes the Row-Reduced Echelon Form of a matrix.
- **Features:**
  - Accepts input matrix in a suitable format.
  - Implements Gaussian elimination algorithm to calculate RREF.
  - Outputs the RREF matrix.

### Big Number Calculator (256-bit)
- **Purpose:** Performs arithmetic operations on big numbers with precision up to 256 bits.
- **Features:**
  - Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
  - Handles large numbers efficiently using assembly language.
  - Outputs results accurately with high precision.

## Implementation Details

- **Programming Languages:** Intel and IBM Assembly Language.
- **Platform:** Cross-platform.
- **Compatibility:** Compatible with x86 architecture.
- **Dependencies:** None.

## Usage

1. **RREF Calculator:**
   - Provide the input matrix to the program.
   - Run the program to obtain the RREF matrix.

2. **Big Number Calculator (256-bit):**
   - Input the numbers and specify the desired arithmetic operation.
   - Execute the program to perform the calculation.
   - View the result accurately with high precision.
